*This file IS NOT a trojan or backdoor. If you don't trust me, install python3 and run the source file.
Some virustotal engines have marked it as a dangerous file thanks to the compilation process using pyinstaller, anyway, if u guys are doubtful about this, just execute the source file (main.py) instead of the compiled one :D*

#### ***Riot has already applied a hotfix for this bug. I will keep the repository here for research purposes only***
